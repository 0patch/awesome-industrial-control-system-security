            Redpoint is a Digital Bond research project to enumerate ICS applications and devices using nmap extensions.
            It can be used during assessments to discover ICS devices and pull information that would be helpful in secondary testing. 
            The Redpoint tools use legitimate protocol or application commands to discover and enumerate devices and applications. 
            There is no effort to exploit or crash anything, but be wise and careful.

            GasPot is a honeypot that has been designed to simulate a Veeder Root Gaurdian AST. These Tank Gauges are common in the oil and gas industry for Gas Station tanks to help with Inventory of fuels. GasPot was designed to randomize as much as possible so no two instances look exactly the same.
